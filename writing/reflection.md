## Your Name Here

## 1. Program Output

### Running Your Completed Sensor Dashboard

TODO: Copy and paste the output from running your completed program below. Use a fenced code block with ```text.

```text
TODO: Paste your actual program output here when you run it with your sensor simulation data.
This should show all sections: welcome, sensor setup, sensor analysis, and IoT recommendations.
```

### Brief Summary of Key Sensor Results

TODO: Write 2-3 sentences summarizing the most interesting sensor analysis your program produced. For example:
- What was your temperature in both Fahrenheit and Celsius?
- Which sensor had the most "concerning" readings that might trigger alerts?
- What was your unique device ID and what does it represent?

## 2. Peer Interaction and Sensor Data Comparison

### Sensor Data Comparison Activity

TODO: Describe your experience during the lab session when you compared sensor readings with classmates:

- Which classmate had the most interesting or concerning sensor readings?
- What creative sensor analysis or status determination did you see that impressed you?
- How did comparing different "environments" help you understand IoT data analysis concepts?

### Collaborative IoT Learning

TODO: Write about how working with peers during sensor comparison helped your understanding:

- What question did a classmate ask about sensor thresholds or status that made you think differently?
- How did explaining your sensor analysis logic to someone else help solidify your understanding?
- What debugging help did you give or receive for sensor calculations?

## 3. Problem Solving and Debugging in IoT Context

### Most Challenging Sensor Calculation

TODO: Describe the most difficult sensor analysis issue you encountered:

- What was the error or unexpected sensor result?
- What debugging steps did you take to fix sensor calculations?
- How did you eventually solve it?
- What resources (slides, documentation, peers, instructor) were most helpful for IoT concepts?

### Learning from IoT Programming Mistakes

TODO: Reflect on your problem-solving process for sensor simulation:

- How has your approach to debugging sensor calculations improved?
- What will you do differently when we start working with real sensors in the next lab?

## 4. Creative Expression and IoT Extensions

### Sensor Dashboard Personal Touches

TODO: Describe the creative elements you added to make your sensor dashboard unique:

- What additional sensor types or analysis did you add beyond the requirements?
- How did you make your IoT dashboard visually appealing and professional?
- What unique sensor status messages or recommendations did you include?

### Future IoT Improvements

TODO: If you had more time, what additional sensor features would you add? How might you use the conditional statements we're learning next to make smarter sensor decisions?

## 5. Bridge to Next Lab: Real Hardware with Pico 2W

### Preparing for Physical Sensors

TODO: Reflect on how this simulation prepared you for working with the Pico 2W:

- What sensor concepts from this lab will transfer directly to real hardware?
- Which calculations will be useful when processing real sensor data?
- How did thinking about IoT device status help you understand what we'll build?

### Excitement for Conditionals and Hardware

TODO: Write about what you're most excited to try in the next lab:

- Which type of real sensor (temperature, light, moisture, motion) interests you most?
- How do you think conditional statements (if/else) will improve your sensor analysis?
- What kind of IoT project would you like to build by the end of the course?

## 6. Connecting to Course Learning Outcomes

### Python Programming Fundamentals (LO1)

TODO: Explain how this IoT simulation lab helped you practice Python fundamentals. Which concepts do you feel most confident about for sensor programming? Which need more practice?

### Industry-Standard Practices (LO2)

TODO: Reflect on the IoT programming practices you used:
- How did you organize your code with sensor-specific comments and sections?
- What conventions did you follow for IoT variable naming (temperature_f, device_id, etc.)?
- How did you test your sensor calculations as you developed them?

## 7. Overall Reflection

### Most Valuable IoT Learning

TODO: Write 2-3 sentences about the most important thing you learned from this sensor simulation assignment - both technically and in terms of IoT thinking.

### Preparation for Hardware Labs

TODO: How do you think the sensor simulation concepts from this lab will help you when we start using real Pico 2W hardware in the next lab? What foundation has this lab provided for physical computing projects?
