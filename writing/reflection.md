# Lab 1: Digital Sensor Simulation Dashboard - Reflection

## Your Name Here

## 1. Program Output

### Running Your Completed Sensor Dashboard

TODO: Copy and paste the output from running your completed program below. Use a fenced code block with ```text.

```text
TODO: Paste your actual program output here when you run it with your sensor simulation data.
This should show all sections: welcome, sensor setup, sensor analysis, and IoT recommendations.
```

### Brief Summary of Key Sensor Results

TODO: Write 2-3 sentences summarizing the most interesting sensor analysis your program produced. For example:
- What was your temperature in both Fahrenheit and Celsius?
- Which sensor had the most "concerning" readings that might trigger alerts?
- What was your unique device ID and what does it represent?

## 2. Peer Interaction and Lab Session Learning

TODO: Describe your experience during the lab session working on the sensor simulation:

- What was the most helpful discussion you had with a classmate or a TL?
- Which assignment section did you find most challenging, and how did peer or TL help assist you?
- What programming concept (input/output, type conversion, arithmetic) did you better understand through lab discussion?

## 3. Problem Solving and Debugging

### Most Challenging Sensor Calculation

TODO: Describe the most difficult sensor calculation issue you encountered:

- What was the error or unexpected sensor result?
- What debugging steps did you take to fix sensor calculations?
- How did you eventually solve it?
- What resources (slides, documentation, peers, instructor) were most helpful for this lab's concepts?

### Learning from Programming Mistakes

TODO: Reflect on your problem-solving process for sensor simulation:

- How has your approach to debugging sensor calculations improve?
- What will you do differently in the future?

## 4. Creative Expression and IoT Extensions

### Sensor Dashboard Personal Touches

TODO: Describe the creative elements you added to make your sensor dashboard unique:

- How did you make your IoT dashboard visually appealing and professional?
- What unique sensor status messages or recommendations did you include?

### Future IoT Improvements

TODO: If you had more time, what additional sensor features would you add?
